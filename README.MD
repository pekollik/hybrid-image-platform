# Hybrid Image of Multiple Fantastical Characters

## Overview

**Author:** Juhapekka Ollikainen  
**Keywords:** creative coding, computational creativity, creative writing, roleplaying games, Python, scripting

This project builds on the research paper *“Hybrid Image of Multiple Fantastical Characters”*  
(published in the *Conference Proceedings, Paris, France, September 20–21, 2022*, p. 262).  
The goal is to design an open data API and Blender add-on that generate **hybrid mythological characters** — blending story archetypes, creatures, and public-domain sources into 3D assets and narrative metadata.

The system develops in **two phases**:

1. **Phase 1 — Open Data API:**  
   Provide access to story fragments, character schemas, and hybrid design metadata.

2. **Phase 2 — Blender Add-on:**  
   Allow artists, writers, and game developers to generate 3D character prototypes directly in Blender, using the open narrative data.
